Dear Admissions Officer,

I am writing this recommendation in support of Ms. Chieh-Yu Shih's application to your Master's Program in 
Management of Health Policy and Administration. I feel strongly that Ms. Shih is a well-qualified candidate 
and will be an asset in your school as she was in ours.

Ms. Shih was first a student at our center and later because of her excellent performance, was asked to 
work as a teaching assistant from June 1998 until now. Her duties as a teaching assistant include attending
to teachers' requests in classrooms, helping students' individual needs and speaking to her classes everyday. 
Ms. Shih has out-performed our expectations. She is a responsible person who prepares carefully ahead of
class everyday. We have never heard any complaints from the teachers she works with.

Since 1998, Ms. Shih has led 7 classes and worked with over 1000 students. Being a teaching assistant can
sometimes be a tiring job, as one must constantly resolve every student's questions and problems. The job 
can also get repetitive and exhausting. Nonetheless, Ms. Shih works patiently with each and every one of 
her students. Ms. Shih also works well with her co-workers and is well liked by her peers.

I find Ms. Shih's excellent performance as a teaching assistant to be a good indicator that she will excel in 
your program and later in her career pursuit. Ms. Shih has demonstrated leadership potential, attention to 
details, good public speaking ability, organization skills and ability to work in teams. These are all essential 
managerial qualities. I recommend Ms. Shih to your program without hesitation. 

Sincerely,

Emily Tsoung

Managing Director
